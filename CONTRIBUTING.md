## Reporting Issues

Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/TheTatu13/turbomecanica-sa-nodejs-scraper/issues) with:
- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior

## Job Sources

A derived scraper extracts jobs from:
- the company's own careers listing (`https://turbomecanica.ro/en/careers/available-jobs/`) + its job sitemap (``)
- ANOFM (by CIF)

If the careers page changes its DOM structure, update the **selector cascades** in
`scraper/config/scraper.json` (primary + fallbacks) — the self-healing cascade in
`scraper/self-healing.js` and the tests in `tests/unit/` mean one broken selector
should not fail a run. Add a test per new fallback level.
